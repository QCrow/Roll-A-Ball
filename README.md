# RollBall
 
The initial plan for this game is to build on the Roll A Ball tutorial and make a rogue-lite type of game where the player can level up, gain more stats and skills by picking up exp cubes.
However, my friend, Zhenyuan (Steven) Tian and I, Yiqiao Wang, have unfortunately no time to add as many features as planned before the deadline.

For now, the game is very straight forward, turrets and different pickups spawn in the game, and the goal is to gather as much points as possible by collecting pickups and destroying enemy turrets by touching them.
Jumping is your best friend! You can dodge a lot of projectiles that way. For now, there is no game end condition because the game is not totally complete yet, but feel free to just roam around and jump on
the turrets while dodging the bullets for as long as you can:)

All implemented features are:

Basic features (asked in the submission):
Respawn
Random rotation for exp cubes
Gazing rotation for power ups
Speedboost (in form of power up pick up)

Extra features implemented:
All related sprites except rectangle HP bar (including unused skills sprites), refer to sprites folder if needed (and drive link in submission) - Yi
Jump - Yi
Turret: including tracking, projectile generation, and projectile motion - Steven
Player health, and HP bar - Yi
Random spawning - pickups, powerups, turrets - Yi
Shield - Steven

If we have more time, we would like to at least implement the leveling feature at least, with some skills such as stopping time, flying, etc.
